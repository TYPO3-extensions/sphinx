Known problems
--------------

- With FAL (TYPO3 6.x) only LocalStorage has been implemented and tested, meaning code will need to be adapted in order to deal with other types of remote storage.

- Sphinx installation may report as having completed successfully although it actually failed when an old version of Python is used (< 2.4).
