Known problems
--------------

- Windows environment has not yet been considered as it is very unlikely that a Python interpreter would be available by default anyway

- With FAL (TYPO3 6.x) only LocalStorage has been implemented and tested, meaning code will need to be adapted in order to deal with other types of remote storage.
