LaTeX versus rst2pdf
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In an attempt to convince you that LaTeX output is indeed much prettier and professional, we rendered the documentation
you are currently reading once with :program:`rst2pdf`:

|pdf_rst2pdf|

and then with LaTeX:

|

|pdf_latex|

The files were generated without any special configuration nor tuning.

.. note::
	One drawback of LaTeX is that it can only be installed globally on your system; this is the reason why this
	extension does not provide a wizard in Extension Manager to install and configure it automatically for you.
