Keep sharing
------------

Finally, please use mailing lists and social networks to share and give feedback about your journey
into text-based documentation with reStructuredText and Sphinx, how you feel about it, which tools
you like, why you are convinced that your friends and followers should jump in as well, ...

But all in all, thanks for using and trusting this extension and understanding that the terrific
code and software you are writing deserves a proper documentation to be usable by others; so that,
in turn, *you* too inspire people to share.
