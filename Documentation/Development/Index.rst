The concept of *signals* and *slots* allows for easy implementation of the `Observer pattern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern>`_ in software, something similar to *hooks* in former versions of TYPO3. Its implementation in TYPO3 CMS has been backported from Flow, so please read chapter `Signals and Slots <http://docs.typo3.org/flow/TYPO3FlowDocumentation/TheDefinitiveGuide/PartIII/SignalsAndSlots.html>`_ from Flow official documentation. In short, *signals* are put into the code and call registered *slots* when run through.

Available signals and slots:
