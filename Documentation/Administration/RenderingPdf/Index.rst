Rendering PDF from ReStructuredText
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sphinx is using *builders* to produce output. The builderâ€™s "name" for PDF is either ``latex`` (best output) or ``rst2pdf``.

``rst2pdf`` is a tool written in Python and available off http://rst2pdf.ralsina.com.ar/. This tool is automatically installed and configured when configuring this extension. PDF output with ``rst2pdf`` is by far not as good as when using LaTeX but it has the real advantage of not requiring you to install a full LaTeX stack on your machine.

.. warning::
	**MS Windows Users:** Automatic installation of ``rst2pdf`` is unfortunately not yet supported for you as it requires additional components such as a GCC compiler. Please refer to http://forge.typo3.org/issues/49530.

The remainder of this chapter guides you through installation and configuration of LaTeX:
